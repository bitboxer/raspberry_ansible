# Bodos Raspberry PI

This is the configuration for my Raspberry PI.

![Grafana interface](images/grafana.png)

Steps to install it on your machine:

* Basic setup on the Raspberry Pi:
  * Install [NOOBS](https://github.com/procount/noobsconfig/) on the Raspberry
  * Select the non ui version of raspbian
  * Wait till it is installed and login using `pi` and `raspberry` as password
  * Activate ssh as described [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md).
  * Add your ssh key to the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Raspberry
* Setup and run [ansible](http://ansible.com) on your computer to install everything on the Raspberry:
  * Change the IP in the [`hosts`](hosts) file to the IP of your Raspberry
  * Install ansible with `brew install ansible`
  * `sh run.sh`
  * Now you have [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) and [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) installed on the Raspberry.
  * Open `http://[raspberryip]:3000` to see the Grafana interface and go through the
    wizard to configure the database connection (the InfluxDB password can be
    found in the `playbook.yml`)

And now you need some data for your InfluxDB to make it
worth it. For example you could build a small air pollution sensor for around
30â‚¬ to generate the charts above. Details can be found [here](http://luftdaten.info/).
